This marked the start of the «Fortress Europe» policy, of which we assessed the tragic human cost (over 30,000 lives taken since the year 2000) last year. A consortium of 15 journalists, statisticians and developers, under the name Migrants’ Files, assessed the financial cost of Fortress Europe.</p><h3 id="airbus-thales-finmeccanica-profit-handsomely-from-fortress-europe">Airbus, Thales, Finmeccanica profit handsomely from Fortress Europe</h3><p>In the early 2000’s, after a series of European Councils (where heads of state gather) devoted to migration, the European Commission created a working group to steer the research agenda on the topic. The working group included no representative of IOM or UNHCR but the four leading arms manufacturers in Europe (Airbus Group - then EADS, Thales, Finmeccanica and BAE), among others. Investing heavily in lobbying, they managed to carve a policy framework that fit their agenda.</p><p>As a result, many projects aimed at preventing refugees from crossing into Europe were funded with public R&amp;D funds as “Security” expenses. We analyzed 39 projects financed by the research programs of the EU or ESA from 2002 to 2013 which aim primarily or in part at preventing refugees and migrants from reaching Europe. In all, more than €225m of taxpayers’ money was invested.</p><p>The Airbus Group, through 14 subsidiaries, participated in 10 projects. Finmeccanica participated to 16 projects through 13 subsidiaries and Thales to 18 projects (one in two) through 13 subsidiaries.</p><p>Several projects developed satellite solutions to identify refugee boats (MARISS, LIMES, DOLPHIN), surveillance the Southern borders of the EU (OPERAMAR, WIMAAS, AEROCEPTOR) or aim at increasing controls at borders (STABORSEC, EFFISEC, FASTPASS, ABC4EU). INGRESS aimed at improving the fingerprint scanning technology. Four projects (DOGGIES, SNIFFER, SNIFFLES and SNOOPY) develop enhanced noses for dogs, in order for them to better detect refugees at border crossing points. Two projects developed robots that patrol the borders at sea (UNCOSS) and on land (TALOS).</p><p><a class="btn btn-doc btn-md" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OJJIVeSdmzNBUi6aBJIdVtHzv4-opnBewGpVBxJXRgw/edit#gid=6441497" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-table"></i>&nbsp; All data on research projects</a></p><p><a class="btn btn-doc btn-md" href="https://kumu.io/embed/4ee2bc6525a93ec48417f325f5483611" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-share-alt"></i>&nbsp; A draft network visualization of the beneficiaries of these projects</a></p><iframe src="https://kumu.io/embed/784f8a4446b2973ec3931acc715fcd1c" style="width: 100%; height: 400px" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe><h3 id="billions-for-nothing">Billions for nothing</h3><p>Research projects are only a fraction of the public money spent to prevent refugees from reaching Europe. Spain, Italy and Greece have spent at least €70 million to acquire boats, night vision equipment, drones, off-road vehicles etc. Spain and Greece built multiple walls. The walls surrounding Ceuta and Melilla, for instance, cost close to €10 million per year to maintain, while the wall closing off passage to Greece cost Greek taxpayers over €7 million. The Italian government tried repeatedly to convince Libyan strongmen to prevent refugees from crossing into Italy, by ways of paying for detention centers and deportation flights from Libya. Since 2011, Italian taxpayers paid over €17 million in gifts in kind to Libyan authorities, such as boats, trainings and night vision goggles for the express purpose of tracking refugees and migrants.</p><p>A large part of these member states’ spending is financed by the other 25 taxpayers’ money under programs run by the European Commission. However, the lack of transparency of the member states did not let us find precisely what amounts originated from which EC programs.</p><p>Frontex, a center that coordinates the border guards of the Dublin Regulation member states, already gobbled up close to a billion euros. Under its aegis, Member states are setting up coordination centers for close to €200 million. The goal, branded as EUROSUR, is to share real-time surveillance of the borders of the EU.</p><p>Regulations agreed on by member states and coordinated by the European Commission, such as EURODAC, a database of fingerprints, add layers of complexity to the issue. EURODAC, for instance, lets member states deport asylum seekers to other member states where they applied for asylum before, but they don’t know how good their software is. At least 10 persons have been wrongly deported due to false hits (when the system wrongfully states that a person is already in the database), but the true number might be much higher. According to an employee of a leading manufacturer of fingerprint scanning devices who accepted to talk on condition of anonymity, each fingerprint scanning device is set to work at a certain rate of false hits. However, he could not get access to the rate of false hits set for the devices of the EURODAC network.</p><p>More worryingly, the European Commission itself is badly informed of the issue. Despite the billion of euros poured in Frontex, the Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs does not know what data its own agencies collect.</p><p><a class="btn btn-doc btn-md" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wC72sDmuN-mvwgMcSWhO-R3E-1wmSE19B_KiW7RBRSc/edit#gid=171341358" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-table"></i>&nbsp; All data on amounts spent</a></p><h3 id="counting-the-cost-of-deportations">Counting the cost of deportations</h3><p>The largest cost associated with the Fortress Europe policies had never been assessed. Since 2000, European governments party to the so-called Dublin Regulation, which coordinate asylum in Europe (all EU members plus Norway, Switzerland and Iceland), deported or returned more than 3.2 million men and women for administrative reasons (unlawful stay on a member state’s territory) at a cost of at least €12.6 billion. Studies have been made to measure the cost of asylum policies, but not one had ever been made at the European level to assess the cost of deportation policies.</p><p>Only one administration, Belgium, keeps track of the costs of deportations. All other we contacted had no idea how much they spent to deport foreigners. In Sweden, only the transport costs are assessed, not the detention costs. In Germany, administration officials told us that they did not “have the capacity” to calculate the costs of deportations. Two Parliamentary committees, in France and Italy, researched the topic. Their estimates were 2 to 4 times higher than the costs reported by the police, showing that administrations tends to hide some costs associated with their deportations policies.</p><p>Similarly, the number of persons deported is not measured. There are over 10 legal ways to expel a non-citizen, from voluntary returns to deportations. No public body tried to harmonize national figures to know precisely how many women and men are deported in the name of the European people. Eurostat, the statistics agency of the European Commission, does keep a database of “returns following an order to leave”. When asked a specific question about their data, Eurostat staff could not provide an answer, despite our multiple requests for clarification. Leanne Weber, a researcher at Monash University (Australia) who led a study on the quantitative aspects of deportation, says that this behavior “points to a major lack of accountability when states use their powers to expel non-citizens”.</p><p>Despite these hurdles, the data we managed to gather is coherent across time and space, and lets us estimate the cost of a deportation. Member states spent on average 4,000€ to deport a man or a woman, half of these costs in transport. Altogether, the cost of deportations in Europe is close to a billion euro per year.</p><p><a class="btn btn-doc btn-md" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rDThuJ1HVTsWWPEvauOIGuY0kd7h8fGkrxebmlMt7h4/edit#gid=0" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-table"></i>&nbsp; All data on deportations</a></p><h3 id="the-more-taxpayers-pay-the-more-refugees-pay">The more taxpayers pay, the more refugees pay</h3><p>High-tech solutions designed to prevent refugees from crossing into Europe, the militarization of the Greek, Italian and Spanish borders and the millions of deportations have done nothing to deter refugees from attempting to reach Europe.</p><p>Since 2000, 1.2 million refugees and migrants crossed into Europe undocumented. Several millions more crossed using fake passports or overstaying their visas. Considering only the undocumented refugees and migrants, our research shows that they gave €17 billion to facilitators who helped them reach Europe.</p><p>It is unclear whether prices or the facilitators’ margins have gone up since the civil war in Syria. Very little is known about how facilitators operate. The governments of Syria and Libya, for instance, are believed to have organized refugees boat as a source of revenue and a token of exchange in the negotiations with European member states. Facilitators acting out of compassion are considered criminals by most European legislations, making a distinction between human traffickers and helpers of refugees legally impossible.</p><p>While prices may not have risen in recent years, the high demand by Syrian refugees led facilitators to cater specifically to their needs - at a high cost. Solutions such as a $100,000 zodiac ride from Libya to Italy for a single family have appeared. The market is divided across national and racial lines, Blacks paying on average around €700 to cross to Europe in the hull of boats, with no hope of survival in case of a shipwreck, while richer Arabs pay €2,000 to travel on the same boat, on the deck.</p><p>The most popular way to Europe remains to travel by plane, but no data exist on the number of people who used a facilitator. Anecdotal evidence show that reaching Europe by air requires complex facilitation strategy. Iraqi refugees, for instance, can pay $16,000 to fly to Paris via Cayenne, Belem, Sao Paulo and Istanbul from Mosul. Moroccan facilitators offered migrants to reach Paris by air, escaping Charles de Gaulle airport through a secret route, thanks to accomplices in the airport staff and in the police (cost: €5,000 including the plane ticket).</p><p>The statistical methods we chose provide an absolute minimum number (see Methodology on the document linked below) and covers only journeys by sea or land. Several testimonies of refugees show the complexity of the schemes they have to go through, sometimes travelling over 20,000km by plane to reach Europe from Syria.</p><p><a class="btn btn-doc btn-md" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cynO8lp6crS4p9kJZUqYUigEB15F2cAwGm7aD9cwoZU/edit#gid=779131653" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-table"></i>&nbsp; All data on money paid by refugees and migrants</a></p></div><div class="main__article__sidebar col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1"><h3 class="main__article__sidebar__title">Stories</h3><h3 class="main__article__sidebar__title">Partners</h3><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Libération" src="assets/images/liberation.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Dnevnik" src="assets/images/dnevnik.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="SRF" src="assets/images/srf.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Avgi" src="assets/images/avgi.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Der Standard" src="assets/images/derstandard.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Vice News" src="assets/images/vicenews.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Süddeutsche Zeitung" src="assets/images/sz.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Information" src="assets/images/information.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Český rozhlas" src="assets/images/czrozhlas.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Gazeta" src="assets/images/gazeta.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Groene Amsterdammer" src="assets/images/groeneamsterdammer.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="El Confidencial" src="https://detective-io.s3.amazonaws.com/img/partners/02%20-%20El%20Confidencial.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Radiobubble" src="https://detective-io.s3.amazonaws.com/img/partners/03%20-%20Radiobubble.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="Sydsvenskan" src="https://detective-io.s3.amazonaws.com/img/partners/04%20-%20Sydsvenskan.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="lespresso" src="https://detective-io.s3.amazonaws.com/img/partners/05%20-%20lespresso.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><div class="main__article__sidebar__partner"><img alt="HLB" src="https://detective-io.s3.amazonaws.com/img/partners/06%20-%20HLB.png" class="img-thumbnail"></div><h3 class="main__article__sidebar__title">Credits</h3><p><strong>Coordination</strong>: Journalism++</p><p><strong>Research and code</strong>: Elaine Allaby, Michail Batikas (Radiobubble), Michael Bauer (Der Standard), Ana Isabel Carvalho (Journalism++ Porto), Jakob Espersen, Daniele Grasso (El Confidencial), Peter Grensund (Journalism++ Stockholm), Sylke Grunwald (SRF), Markus Hametner (Der Standard), Kristian Holgersen, Alice Kohli, Ricardo Lafuente (Journalism++ Porto), Alexandre Léchenet (Libération), Jean-Marc Manach, Andrea Nelson Mauro (Dataninja), Jacopo Ottaviani, Adam Rodriques (Global Initiative), Lise Møller Schilder, Katerina Stavroula (Radiobubble).</p><p><strong>Research assistants</strong>: Clotilde Lavergne-Bril, Niklas Swedberg.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="counting-the-dead" class="main__article main__article--second"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="main__article__body col-sm-7"><h2 class="main__article__title">Counting the dead</h2><p>They know their lives are at risk, yet each year thousands of people from Africa, the Middle East and beyond — war refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants — leave their homes and try to reach the promised land of Europe. On the third of October 2013, more than 360 would-be emigrants drowned off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa. A catastrophe of this dimension grabbed the media’s attention for a while and won the sympathy of the general public.</p><p>In response, later that month, the European Council decided to implement measures aimed at preventing a repeat of such a tragedy at the European Union&#39;s borders .The Council called for strengthening the EU’s border security co-ordination system, Frontex, more formally known as the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union. And the Europe-wide surveillance system Eurosur began operations on December 2, 2013. Thus, once again, a large tragedy spurred real, if belated, action.</p><p>Well-intended though they doubtless were, these measures only address the tip of the migration iceberg. Little is known about how many men, women and children actually have lost their lives on their journey to Europe. Believing that policy unsupported by facts cannot be optimal, a consortium of European journalists committed themselves to systematically assembling and analyzing the data on the deaths of Europe’s would-be migrants. The Migrants&#39; Files project is partially funded by the European non-profit organization Journalismfund.eu.</p><h3 id="data-sources">Data sources</h3><p>By compiling rigorous datasets from various sources, The Migrants&#39; Files team aims at creating a comprehensive and reliable database on migrants&#39; deaths. Principal data sources for this effort include United for Intercultural Action, a non-profit whose network comprises over 550 organizations across Europe, and Fortress Europe, founded by the journalist and author Gabriele Del Grande, which also monitors the deaths and disappearances of migrants to Europe. The Migrants&#39; Files’ database also uses data from Puls, a project run by the University of Helsinki, Finland and commissioned by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission.</p><p>A consistent methodology is applied to all data, starting with so-called “open-source intelligence” (OSINT). Originated by the intelligence services, this approach collects data from publicly available sources such as media reports, government publications and grey literature. In the case of The Migrants&#39; Files, the number migrants who die while seeking refuge in Europe is obtained by monitoring real-time global news on asylum seekers, migration and human trafficking activities in and around Europe.</p><p>United for Intercultural Action monitored emigrant fatalities from 1993 until 2012, documenting about 17,000 deaths. Gabriele Del Grande reports more than 19,000 deaths since 1988. The database of The Migrants&#39; Files covers the period from January 1, 2000, until today.</p><p>The journalists of The Migrants&#39; Files noted that the various data sources often lacked compatibility since each organization structures its intelligence differently. This required extensive data cleaning and fact-checking, using OpenRefine, an open source analysis tool. In a second stage, The Migrants&#39; Files journalists established a database on Detective.io, a web-based tool specifically designed to support information gathering efforts for large-scale investigative reporting projects.</p><p>Early in the process of establishing The Migrants&#39; Files’ data methodology, sixteen students from the Laboratory of Data Journalism at the University of Bologna, Italy, contributed valuable fact-checking of more than 250 incidents, supervised by Prof. Carlo Gubitosa.</p><p>The Migrants&#39; Files database of emigrant deaths now structures the data according to name, age, gender and nationality. Every fatal incident is recorded with its date, latitude, longitude, number of dead and/or missing as well as the cause.</p><h3 id="margins-for-error">Margins for error</h3><p>Overcoming the issue of data compatibility, The Migrants&#39; Files journalists have managed to create the most comprehensive survey of European migration fatalities available today. That said, the project team is aware that biases inherent in every dataset cannot be fully eliminated.</p><p>What’s more, aggregating several sources of data can easily produce duplicates. When duplicates are detected are manually removed, one at a time. Accuracy is laborious.</p><p>Beyond duplicates, some individuals had been registered as missing, say, identified by survivors of a shipwreck. If a body washes ashore in another location days or weeks later, it is virtually impossible to assign it to an earlier incident. And some fatal incidents have not been reported in any form. Hence, other sources of intelligence, such as testimonies, are carefully reviewed and double-checked before registering an incident in the database. Nonetheless, there is no getting around the fact that some individuals and events cannot be documented since no evidence offers confirmation. This sad reality cannot be redressed, rendering all fatality estimates conservative. The true numbers of dead are doubtless higher than recorded.</p><p>Moreover, assessing the geolocation and mapping the registered incidents imposes other kinds of difficulties. The map of The Migrants’ Files also presents incidents far from European borders due to the methodology used. For example, a boat capsized on its route from Algeria to Spain can be geolocated in Algeria and at the country’s center.</p><p>The Migrants’ Files is ongoing. The team continues to collect intelligence on the deaths of Europe’s would-be emigrants. The project aims to further improve the quality of its data, to shed more light on the situation of emigrants seeking refuge in Europe and to consistently track European asylum and migration policy, particularly because the broader media often ignores the issue until another large-scale emigrant tragedy thrusts it back to the top of the news cycle.</p><p>If you wish to contribute, please contact us by email debug@themigrantsfiles.com or through the Twitter hashtag #MigrantsFiles.</p><p>The database is made available under the Open Database License: <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/">http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/</a> Cover picture: Spanish coastguards intercept a migrants&#39; boat off Tenerife © UNHCR A.
