A few years after they welcomed half a million Yugoslav refugees, European governments reacted strongly in 1997 against Kurdish refugees fleeing the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq, at the time when the Schengen agreement was just entering into force. This marked the start of the «Fortress Europe» policy, of which we assessed the tragic human cost (over 30,000 lives taken since the year 2000) last year. A consortium of 15 journalists, statisticians and developers, under the name Migrants’ Files, assessed the financial cost of Fortress Europe.

### Airbus, Thales, Finmeccanica profit handsomely from Fortress Europe

In the early 2000’s, after a series of European Councils (where heads of state gather) devoted to migration, the European Commission created a working group to steer the research agenda on the topic. The working group included no representative of IOM or UNHCR but the four leading arms manufacturers in Europe (Airbus Group - then EADS, Thales, Finmeccanica and BAE), among others. Investing heavily in lobbying, they managed to carve a policy framework that fit their agenda.

As a result, many projects aimed at preventing refugees from crossing into Europe were funded with public R&D funds as “Security” expenses. We analyzed 39 projects financed by the research programs of the EU or ESA from 2002 to 2013 which aim primarily or in part at preventing refugees and migrants from reaching Europe. In all, more than €225m of taxpayers’ money was invested.

The Airbus Group, through 14 subsidiaries, participated in 10 projects. Finmeccanica participated to 16 projects through 13 subsidiaries and Thales to 18 projects (one in two) through 13 subsidiaries. 

Several projects developed satellite solutions to identify refugee boats (MARISS, LIMES, DOLPHIN), surveillance the Southern borders of the EU (OPERAMAR, WIMAAS, AEROCEPTOR) or aim at increasing controls at borders (STABORSEC, EFFISEC, FASTPASS, ABC4EU). INGRESS aimed at improving the fingerprint scanning technology. Four projects (DOGGIES, SNIFFER, SNIFFLES and SNOOPY) develop enhanced noses for dogs, in order for them to better detect refugees at border crossing points. Two projects developed robots that patrol the borders at sea (UNCOSS) and on land (TALOS).

### Billions for nothing

Research projects are only a fraction of the public money spent to prevent refugees from reaching Europe. Spain, Italy and Greece have spent at least €70 million to acquire boats, night vision equipment, drones, off-road vehicles etc. Spain and Greece built multiple walls. The walls surrounding Ceuta and Melilla, for instance, cost close to €10 million per year to maintain, while the wall closing off passage to Greece cost Greek taxpayers over €7 million. The Italian government tried repeatedly to convince Libyan strongmen to prevent refugees from crossing into Italy, by ways of paying for detention centers and deportation flights from Libya. Since 2011, Italian taxpayers paid over €17 million in gifts in kind to Libyan authorities, such as boats, trainings and night vision goggles for the express purpose of tracking refugees and migrants.

A large part of these member states’ spending is financed by the other 25 taxpayers’ money under programs run by the European Commission. However, the lack of transparency of the member states did not let us find precisely what amounts originated from which EC programs.

Frontex, a center that coordinates the border guards of the Dublin Regulation member states, already gobbled up close to a billion euros. Under its aegis, Member states are setting up coordination centers for close to €200 million. The goal, branded as EUROSUR, is to share real-time surveillance of the borders of the EU.

Regulations agreed on by member states and coordinated by the European Commission, such as EURODAC, a database of fingerprints, add layers of complexity to the issue. EURODAC, for instance, lets member states deport asylum seekers to other member states where they applied for asylum before, but they don’t know how good their software is. At least 10 persons have been wrongly deported due to false hits (when the system wrongfully states that a person is already in the database), but the true number might be much higher. According to an employee of a leading manufacturer of fingerprint scanning devices who accepted to talk on condition of anonymity, each fingerprint scanning device is set to work at a certain rate of false hits. However, he could not get access to the rate of false hits set for the devices of the EURODAC network.

More worryingly, the European Commission itself is badly informed of the issue. Despite the billion of euros poured in Frontex, the Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs does not know what data its own agencies collect.

### Counting the cost of deportations

The largest cost associated with the Fortress Europe policies had never been assessed. Since 2000, European governments party to the so-called Dublin Regulation, which coordinate asylum in Europe (all EU members plus Norway, Switzerland and Iceland), deported or returned more than 3.2 million men and women for administrative reasons (unlawful stay on a member state’s territory) at a cost of at least €12.6 billion. Studies have been made to measure the cost of asylum policies, but not one had ever been made at the European level to assess the cost of deportation policies.

Only one administration, Belgium, keeps track of the costs of deportations. All other we contacted had no idea how much they spent to deport foreigners. In Sweden, only the transport costs are assessed, not the detention costs. In Germany, administration officials told us that they did not “have the capacity” to calculate the costs of deportations. Two Parliamentary committees, in France and Italy, researched the topic. Their estimates were 2 to 4 times higher than the costs reported by the police, showing that administrations tends to hide some costs associated with their deportations policies.

Similarly, the number of persons deported is not measured. There are over 10 legal ways to expel a non-citizen, from voluntary returns to deportations. No public body tried to harmonize national figures to know precisely how many women and men are deported in the name of the European people. Eurostat, the statistics agency of the European Commission, does keep a database of “returns following an order to leave”. When asked a specific question about their data, Eurostat staff could not provide an answer, despite our multiple requests for clarification. Leanne Weber, a researcher at Monash University (Australia) who led a study on the quantitative aspects of deportation, says that this behavior “points to a major lack of accountability when states use their powers to expel non-citizens”.

Despite these hurdles, the data we managed to gather is coherent across time and space, and lets us estimate the cost of a deportation. Member states spent on average 4,000€ to deport a man or a woman, half of these costs in transport. Altogether, the cost of deportations in Europe is close to a billion euro per year.

### The more taxpayers pay, the more refugees pay
High-tech solutions designed to prevent refugees from crossing into Europe, the militarization of the Greek, Italian and Spanish borders and the millions of deportations have done nothing to deter refugees from attempting to reach Europe.

Since 2000, 1.2 million refugees and migrants crossed into Europe undocumented. Several millions more crossed using fake passports or overstaying their visas. Considering only the undocumented refugees and migrants, our research shows that they gave €17 billion to facilitators who helped them reach Europe.

It is unclear whether prices or the facilitators’ margins have gone up since the civil war in Syria. Very little is known about how facilitators operate. The governments of Syria and Libya, for instance, are believed to have organized refugees boat as a source of revenue and a token of exchange in the negotiations with European member states. Facilitators acting out of compassion are considered criminals by most European legislations, making a distinction between human traffickers and helpers of refugees legally impossible.

While prices may not have risen in recent years, the high demand by Syrian refugees led facilitators to cater specifically to their needs - at a high cost. Solutions such as a $100,000 zodiac ride from Libya to Italy for a single family have appeared. The market is divided across national and racial lines, Blacks paying on average around €700 to cross to Europe in the hull of boats, with no hope of survival in case of a shipwreck, while richer Arabs pay €2,000 to travel on the same boat, on the deck.

The most popular way to Europe remains to travel by plane, but no data exist on the number of people who used a facilitator. Anecdotal evidence show that reaching Europe by air requires complex facilitation strategy. Iraqi refugees, for instance, can pay $16,000 to fly to Paris via Cayenne, Belem, Sao Paulo and Istanbul from Mosul. Moroccan facilitators offered migrants to reach Paris by air, escaping Charles de Gaulle airport through a secret route, thanks to accomplices in the airport staff and in the police (cost: €5,000 including the plane ticket).

The statistical methods we chose provide an absolute minimum number (see Methodology on the document linked below) and covers only journeys by sea or land. Several testimonies of refugees show the complexity of the schemes they have to go through, sometimes travelling over 20,000km by plane to reach Europe from Syria.
